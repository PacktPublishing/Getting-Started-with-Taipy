# Chapter 2

In this chapter, we coded a mock-up Taipy Gui application. Each of the directories represents a main step in the building process:

* Part 1: A single page app, with static content.
* Part 2: Multiple page app, we added a unit convertor, to demonstrate Callback.
* Part 3: the final application.

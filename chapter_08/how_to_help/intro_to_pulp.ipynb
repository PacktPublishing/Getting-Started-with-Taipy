    "# Introduction to PuLP\n",
    "\n",
    "In this demo notebook, we‚Äôll take a quick look at [PuLP](https://pypi.org/project/PuLP/), a Python library for defining and solving linear programming (LP) problems. Our app in Chapter 8 uses PuLP to determine which warehouses a company should choose to reduce cost or carbon emissions. \n",
    "\n",
    "You don't need to be an optimization expert to follow along! This is just a lightweight intro so you can understand what‚Äôs happening under the hood when our app uses PuLP to solve problems. We'll be explaining the algorithms from our app, you can find more examples in [PuLP's GitHub repo / documentation](https://github.com/coin-or/pulp).\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Linear Programming?\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear Programming is a mathematical method used to determine the best outcome (like maximum profit or lowest cost) in a situation with certain constraints (like limited resources, time, or capacity). It‚Äôs widely used in fields like logistics, finance, energy, and operations research.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is PuLP?\n",
    "PuLP is a Python library that lets you:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Define optimization problems using Python code\n",
    "* Set constraints and objective functions\n",
    "* Use solvers (like CBC, which comes with PuLP) to find optimal solutions. I also provides an API to use commercial solvers such as CPLEX, GUROBI and more\n",
    "\n",
    "It‚Äôs a great tool for integrating optimization into Python applications, just like our demo app!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Application Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Our app tries to solve a **facility location problem** using linear programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step of the application DOES NOT involve Linear Programming: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. First, we need to read in the data from our CSV files\n",
    "2. Then we calculate a distance matrix between customers and warehouses using the [haversine formumla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula) (we create a function)"

This guides the solver to minimize the total impact.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- **Adding Constraints**: We then add necessary constraints through `_add_constraints()`, which calls:\n",
    "    - `_add_customer_assignment_constraints()` to ensure every customer is assigned to exactly one warehouse\n",
    "    - `_add_warehouse_selection_constraints()` to allow customer assignments only to open warehouses\n",
    "    - `_add_number_of_warehouses_constraints()` to set how many warehouses should be selected\n",
    "    - `_add_country_constraints()` (optional) to force selected countries in the solution\n",
    "        \n",
    "- **Solving the Optimization**: All of these steps are orchestrated in the main `create_pulp_model()` function, which calls PuLP‚Äôs solver to find the optimal solution.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- **Extracting Results**: Finally, `_interpret_solution()` reads the solution variables, and `_format_results()` converts the data into two pandas DataFrames: one summarizing selected warehouses, and one with customer assignment details.\n",

    "### Step 4: Adding Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "These functions tells the optimization model how the problem works. It defines the rules (called **constraints**) that the solution must follow. Without these rules, the model could give us crazy or meaningless results.\n",
    "\n",
    "With PuLP, we build the problem by combining an objective function (from the function beofre this one!) with a list of constraints (what the solution is allowed to do). --> This function add the constraints to the same `prob` element. \n",
    "\n",
    "In other words: The objective + the constraints define a problem to solve.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What constraints we add, and WHY:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Each customer must be assigned to exactly one warehouse**\n",
    "\n",
    "We use `_add_customer_assignment_constraints()` to make sure every customer is served, but by only one warehouse. This prevents the optimizer from ignoring or duplicating customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Customers can only be assigned to warehouses that are open**\n",
    "\n",
    "`_add_warehouse_selection_constraints()` enforces that customers can‚Äôt be assigned to a warehouse unless it‚Äôs actually been selected (opened). This reflects real-world logic: we can‚Äôt deliver from closed locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Limit the total number of warehouses**\n",
    "\n",
    "With `_add_number_of_warehouses_constraints()`, we let the user control how many warehouses to open. If the user specifies a number, we enforce it exactly. If they choose \"any\", we allow a range (1‚Äì10).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **(Optional) Require warehouses in specific countries**\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, for strategic, political, or logistical reasons, we want to make sure we operate in certain countries.  \n",
    "`_add_country_constraints()` allows the user to specify required countries. If passed a list like `[\"Germany\", \"France\"]`, the model is required to open **at least one warehouse** in each country.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these are combined by `_add_constraints()`, which calls each of the specialized helpers in order. This results in a clean, readable setup where each rule is easy to isolate, test, and understand."

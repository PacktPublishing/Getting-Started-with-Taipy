    "# Introduction to PuLP\n",
    "\n",
    "In this demo notebook, we‚Äôll take a quick look at [PuLP](https://pypi.org/project/PuLP/), a Python library for defining and solving linear programming (LP) problems. Our app in Chapter 8 uses PuLP to determine which warehouses a company should choose to reduce cost or carbon emissions. \n",
    "\n",
    "You don't need to be an optimization expert to follow along! This is just a lightweight intro so you can understand what‚Äôs happening under the hood when our app uses PuLP to solve problems. We'll be explaining the algorithms from our app, you can find more examples in [PuLP's GitHub repo / documentation](https://github.com/coin-or/pulp).\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Linear Programming?\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear Programming is a mathematical method used to determine the best outcome (like maximum profit or lowest cost) in a situation with certain constraints (like limited resources, time, or capacity). It‚Äôs widely used in fields like logistics, finance, energy, and operations research.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is PuLP?\n",
    "PuLP is a Python library that lets you:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Define optimization problems using Python code\n",
    "* Set constraints and objective functions\n",
    "* Use solvers (like CBC, which comes with PuLP) to find optimal solutions. I also provides an API to use commercial solvers such as CPLEX, GUROBI and more\n",
    "\n",
    "It‚Äôs a great tool for integrating optimization into Python applications, just like our demo app!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Application Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Our app tries to solve a **facility location problem** using linear programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step of the application DOES NOT involve Linear Programming: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. First, we need to read in the data from our CSV files\n",
    "2. Then we calculate a distance matrix between customers and warehouses using the [haversine formumla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula) (we create a function)"

    "\n",
    "This function tells the optimization model how the problem works. It defines the rules (called **constraints**) that the solution must follow. Without these rules, the model could give us crazy or meaningless results.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "In other words: The objective + the constraints define a problem to solve.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What constraints we add, and WHY:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Each customer must be assigned to exactly one warehouse**\n",
    "\n",
    "Every customer needs to receive deliveries from some warehouse, but only one. \n",
    "This constraint forces the model to pick exactly one warehouse for each customer.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Customers can only be assigned to warehouses that are open**\n",
    "\n",
    "We don‚Äôt want the model to assign customers to warehouses we didn‚Äôt even open ‚Äî that would be like shipping from an imaginary location.\n",
    "This rule ties the assignment of a customer to a warehouse to whether that warehouse is actually selected/open.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Limit the total number of warehouses**\n",
    "\n",
    "The end application lets users select how many warehouses to add to the solution. Sometimes we want exactly `n` warehouses, sometimes we‚Äôre flexible.\n",
    "This part adds either:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A fixed number of warehouses (if the user says `number_of_warehouses` = `n`)\n",
    "* Or a reasonable range (like between 1 and 10), if the user just says \"any\"\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **(Optional) Require warehouses in specific countries**\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, for strategic, political, or logistical reasons, we want to make sure we operate in certain countries.\n",
    "If the user passes a list like [\"France\", \"Germany\"], this rule tells the model:\n",

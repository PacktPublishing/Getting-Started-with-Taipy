While data analysts, data scientists, and BI experts have the tools to analyze data, build models, and create compelling visuals, they often struggle to translate these insights into practical, user-friendly applications that help end users answer real-world questions, such as identifying revenue trends, predicting inventory needs, or detecting fraud, without wading through complex code.
Getting Started with Taipy is your comprehensive guide to overcoming this challenge. This book teaches you how to use Taipy, a powerful open-source Python library, to build intuitive, production-ready data apps quickly and efficiently. Instead of creating prototypes that nobody uses, you'll learn how to build faster applications that process large amounts of data for multiple users and deliver measurable business impact. Taipy does the heavy lifting to enable your users to visualize their KPIs, interact with charts and maps, and compare scenarios for better decision-making. You’ll discover how to use Taipy to create apps that make your data accessible and actionable for end users in production environments, such as cloud services or Docker containers.
By the end of this book, you won’t just understand Taipy, you'll be able to transform your data skills into impactful solutions that address real-world needs and deliver valuable insights.</details>

  <summary><h2>Requirements for this book</summary>
<p>Taipy is a Python library designed for teams that manipulate data using Python to take their models, algorithms, and visual representations, and turn them into web applications that run in production environments for multiple users. Therefore, the only strong prerequisite is to know how to use Python.</p>
<p>Having some general knowledge of web development can certainly help, since Taipy apps can be styled using CSS (although this isn’t strictly necessary). Chapter 6 assumes some knowledge of Linux systems, the cloud, and Docker, since it discusses deployment strategies. Some chapters use specialized libraries to create more realistic examples, but the book and the GitHub repo provide examples and comments to understand them.</p>

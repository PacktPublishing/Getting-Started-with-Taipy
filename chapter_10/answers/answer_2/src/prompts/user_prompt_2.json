    "question": "Can I bring an animal with me?",
    "answer": "Yes, you can bring an animal on the NYC subway, but there are rules:\n\nAnimals must be **in a container** and carried in a way that does not annoy other passengers or interfere with operations. The only exception is for **service animals**, which are allowed without a carrier as long as they are leashed or harnessed.\n\nSo, pets are okay if they're in a bag or crate—and yes, that’s why you might see dogs in backpacks or tote bags on the subway!"
